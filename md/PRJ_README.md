# The Final Project

Use what we've learned this semester to build a **Rich Media Web App**.

- **Rich** : It is a compelling, cohesive, seamless, interactive experience.
- **Media** : It uses text, image, video, audio, color, animation, and/or networking.
- **Web App** : It is consumed in the web browser, and makes use of some kind of storage.

This could be a game, tool, interactive art piece, musical instrument ... or something else entirely!

> I know some folks struggle with open-ended ideation.<br />If that's you, see me (in class or [schedule some office hours](https://calendar.app.google/FY1Z7bBzUHCAAjid9)) and we'll come up with an idea together!
