# Homework 3

The goal for this assignment is to seek inspiration, and then prove out your critical path for the Final Project.

1. Familiarize yourself with the [requirements of the Final Project](./PRJ_README.md).
2. Come up with an idea for a project that meets those requirements.
3. Break the project down into the pieces that you're most unsure of.
4. Use Homework 3 to create an experiment / prototype / proof-of-concept that helps you feel better about the uncertainties from Step 3.
5. Write up your experiences with Homework 3 in [HW3_DOCS.md](./HW3_DOCS.md) - which includes a proposal / goal for the Final Project.

> Note: There are no unit or e2e tests provided for this assignment. Grading will be done by me, manually - giving you the flexibility to experiment without the constraints of the tests.

## Requirements

### Documentation

Answer the questions in HW3_DOCS.md, describing:

- Your inspiration for the project.
- What items you chose to include in your prototype.
- The outcome of your experimentation.

|         Name | Points | Description                                      |
| -----------: | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
|        Great | 2      | - HW3_DOCS.md is filled in, thoroughly.          |
|           OK | 1      | - HW3_DOCS.md has some edits, but is incomplete. |
| Insufficient | 0      | - HW3_DOCS.md has no answers.                    |

### Prototype

Create a prototype that proves out your approach for the project. It should:

- Cover the broad feature set of your final project.
- Be simple / rough / bare-bones / low-effort. Placeholder art is encouraged.
- Set you up for success. (fail here in Homework 3, so you can succeed on the Final Project)

|         Name | Points | Description                                                               |
| -----------: | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|        Great | 2      | - The prototype covers the project, and it's clear the hard part is over. |
|           OK | 1      | - An attempt was made, but major parts of the project are not addressed.  |
| Insufficient | 0      | - Little to no attempt was made.                                          |

### Proposal

In HW3_DOCS.md, question 6 is answered

|         Name | Points | Description                                                        |

|        Great | 1      | - We have a clear picture of what you're planning for the project. |
| Insufficient | 0      | - We have little to no idea what you're doing for the project.     |
