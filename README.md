# Homework 3 / Final Project Combination

This repo/assignment is meant to be used for both Homework 3 and the Final Project.

You can find the documentation for each milestone in the `md/` directory:

| Document Type        | Homework 3 Link                     | Final Project Link                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Description / Rubric | [HW3_README.md](./md/HW3_README.md) | [PRJ_README.md](./md/PRJ_README.md) |
| Your Documentation   | [HW3_DOCS.md](./md/HW3_DOCS.md)     | [PRJ_DOCS.md](./md/PRJ_DOCS.md)     |
| Your Grade           | [HW3_GRADE.md](./md/HW3_GRADE.md)   | [PRJ_GRADE.md](./md/PRJ_GRADE.md)   |
